# Go DSA & Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of common **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Design Patterns** written in Go. It is designed to help developers learn and reference these concepts in a structured way.

## Contents

- **Go DSA**:
  Implementations of popular data structures and algorithms such as arrays, linked lists, binary trees, sorting algorithms, and more.

- **Design Patterns**:
  Examples of design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc., implemented in Go.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go_dsa_design_patterns.git
   cd go_dsa_design_patterns
   ```

2. Run any specific example:

   ```bash
   go run path/to/your/example.go
   ```

3. Explore and modify the code for learning or integration into your projects.

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) must be installed on your machine.
